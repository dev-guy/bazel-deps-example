This is a starter project using Bazel and the third party bazel_deps. Project creation is described [here](https://github.com/mjbots/bazel_deps). This project adds a Google Test that does nothing.

First, [install Bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html).

Then run the test executable via:

```bash
bazel test
```
